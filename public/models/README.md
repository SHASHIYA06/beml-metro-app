Place a glTF/GLB train model here as `train.glb` to enable the 3D running train in the app.

Recommended sources (permissive licensed):
- Sketchfab / CC0 or CC-BY models (check license before use)
- Khronos glTF Sample Models: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models

Notes:
- Put the model at `/public/models/train.glb` (binary GLB recommended)
- For low-poly performance, choose models with low mesh count and small textures
- Attribution will show: "Created by Shashi Shekhar Mishra"

If you'd like me to add a permissive GLB to this path, say "Proceed with Option B (add model)" and confirm the license preference (I recommend CC0).
